# Contributing to Tailwind v4 Theme Resolver

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. This document outlines the process and guidelines for contributing.

## Development Setup

   bun install
   ```
3. Run tests to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   bun test
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
bun test
```

### Linting

```bash
bun run lint
bun run lint:fix  # Auto-fix issues
```

### Formatting

bun run format
bun run format:check  # Check without modifying
```

### Building

```bash

```

## Code Standards

This project maintains strict code quality standards:

- **TypeScript**: No `any` types, use explicit typing
- **ESLint**: All rules must pass, zero warnings or errors
- **Prettier**: Consistent formatting with single quotes, 80 character line length
- **Testing**: All new features must include tests
- **Documentation**: Update README.md for user-facing changes

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use `Array<T>` instead of `T[]`
- Use `import type` for type-only imports
- Prefer nullish coalescing (`??`) over logical OR (`||`)
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) for safe property access
- No magic numbers (except -1, 0, 1)
- Functions should have cyclomatic complexity under 10

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

feat(parser): add support for custom color scales
fix(build): resolve sourcemap generation issue
